## 🩺 Abstract
Skin lesions are among the most common precursors to serious dermatological conditions such as melanoma. Early detection can significantly reduce risk and improve patient outcomes.  
**SkinAid** presents an automated **IoMT-based (Internet of Medical Things)** system for detecting and classifying skin lesions through deep learning and **Wasserstein-GAN-based data augmentation**.  

The model enhances a limited and highly unbalanced dermatology dataset using synthetic data generation, followed by CNN-based classification for **seven major lesion types**.  
It achieves an overall accuracy of **92.2%**, with real-time deployment on Android devices for remote screening and early diagnosis.

## 🌐 Overview
<img src="Images/design_overview.png" width="1000"/>

SkinAid comprises three major phases:
1. **Preprocessing & ROI Extraction:** isolates the lesion region and removes noise.
2. **Data Augmentation via WGAN-GP:** generates synthetic dermatoscopic samples to balance the dataset.
3. **CNN-based Classification & IoMT Deployment:** classifies lesion types and deploys on Android for real-time use.

## 🧾 Dataset
We use the **HAM10000** (“Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images”) dataset — a benchmark dermatology dataset comprising **10,015 dermatoscopic images** of 7 lesion types:

| Lesion Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| AKIEC | Actinic Keratosis |
| BCC | Basal Cell Carcinoma |
| BKL | Benign Keratosis |
| DF | Dermatofibroma |
| MEL | Melanoma |
| NV | Melanocytic Nevi |
| VASC | Vascular Lesions |

## ⚙️ Preprocessing & ROI Extraction
To ensure high-quality training data, we extracted the **region-of-interest (ROI)** of skin lesions using segmentation masks and morphological transformations.

### (a) ROI Extraction Example:

## 🧬 Synthetic Image Generation (W-GAN-GP)
We used **Wasserstein-GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** to synthetically augment minority lesion classes.

## 🧠 Model Training & Results
To classify the skin lesions, we fine-tuned multiple CNN architectures using **transfer learning**:
- ResNet-50  
- EfficientNet-B0  
- DenseNet-121 *(best performance)*  
- MobileNet-V2  

Each model was trained on the augmented dataset (original + synthetic samples).  
DenseNet-121 achieved **92.2% test accuracy** with improved generalization and balanced class distribution.

## 📱 Mobile App Prototype (IoMT Integration)
We designed a lightweight **Android application** for edge-based inference, enabling **offline lesion detection and classification** in resource-limited environments.

**Features:**
- Real-time lesion capture using a smartphone camera  
- On-device CNN inference (no internet required)  
- Displays lesion type, confidence score, and risk level  
- Ideal for rural healthcare centers and tele-dermatology
